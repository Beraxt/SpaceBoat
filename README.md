# Space Boat
Discord.js Multifunction bot primarily made for the [Space Engine Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/spaceengine)
## Planned features
 - Moderation features such as mute, kick, ban, "roleremove", and some other role addition commands.
 - Logging functionality to log user actions such as leaving and entering the server, information of which is stored in a logging channel.
 - Role stasis, where if a user leaves the server and comes back less than a week after, their roles remain. (mainly to prevent someone from getting rid of their roles)
 - An adaptable "Starboard", where a channel can be made into a starboard, that listens to a set of channels given to it, and the "starring" of messages in said channel.
